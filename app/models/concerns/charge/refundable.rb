  # (Alipay, which settles in up to five minutes) did not complete; "canceled" means a pending refund
  # was canceled before completing. Either way the money is back in our Stripe
  # balance and the buyer did NOT receive it. Per the reversal-depth decision on
  # PR #5779: automatically reverse the balance debits and refunded flags (the
