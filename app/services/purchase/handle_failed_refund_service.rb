# frozen_string_literal: true

# Handles a refund that reached a terminal unsuccessful status ("failed" or
# "canceled") after Stripe had accepted it. Failures happen on asynchronous
# bank-transfer refunds (iDEAL, Bancontact, ACH): the buyer's bank can return the
# money days after the refund was created. Cancellation happens when a pending
# refund is canceled before completing. In both cases Stripe puts the funds back
# in our balance, the buyer has NOT received the money, but our books already
# recorded the refund as if they had.
#
# Reversal depth follows the decision on PR #5779 ("Option B"): automatically reverse
# only the unambiguous money facts, and put everything that needs judgment in a durable
# exception queue. Operational policy determines who handles each new exception and its
# response deadline:
#
#   REVERSED HERE (only when the refund's money lives entirely in Gumroad's own
#   balance ledger — see #auto_reversal_eligible?, which checks the merchant
#   account and dispute state; whether a balance was already paid out does NOT
#   affect eligibility, see below):
#   - Seller/affiliate balance debits: every BalanceTransaction the refund created is
#     offset by an equal-and-opposite transaction, so balances return to their
#     pre-refund state regardless of how the original split seller/affiliate/presentment
#     amounts (mirroring beats recomputing — the original rows are the ground truth).
#     If the debited balance was already paid out, the offset credits a live balance
#     instead — the seller is made whole either way, and the paid-out balance's own
#     records stay untouched.
#   - Retained processor fees: the Credit that retained the fee (see
#     Credit.create_for_refund_fee_retention!) is given back with an offsetting
#     credit marked failed_refund_id, so payout exports show the retention and its
#     give-back as an explicit pair (#reverse_fee_retention_credits!).
#   - Affiliate refund state: AffiliatePartialRefund rows from this refund are
#     removed and the AffiliateCredit refund-balance pointer is repointed to a
#     remaining effective refund's balance (or cleared), so affiliate stats and
#     payout eligibility stop treating the failed refund as real.
#   - Purchase refunded flags and refund-balance pointer: stripe_refunded /
#     stripe_partially_refunded are recomputed WITHOUT the failed refund's amount
#     (on the purchase and on its gift / bundle mirror purchases), and
#     purchase_refund_balance is recomputed from the remaining effective refunds'
#     seller debits (or cleared when none remains), so the purchase becomes
#     re-refundable and per-balance refund stats attribute the surviving refunds
#     to the right balance.
#   - Reporting: this service writes no report rows itself, but every financial /
#     tax / payout report reads refunded sums through Refund.effective, so a
#     reversed refund drops out of them; the immutable finance event ledger books
#     the reversal as its own dated compensating event instead of rewriting the
#     original refund's day.
#
#   DELIBERATELY NOT REVERSED (durable exception queue — FailedRefundException):
#   - Buyer communication: the buyer received a "you've been refunded" email that
#     turned out to be false. What to tell them (and whether to re-refund to a
#     different bank account) is an exception-resolution decision.
#   - Subscription state: if the original refund cancelled a subscription, resuming
#     it could silently restart recurring billing on a buyer who believes they left.
#   - VAT remitted to tax authorities: the reversal takes the refund out of future
#     VAT/sales-tax report output (via Refund.effective), but any remittance already
#     made from an earlier report run needs human follow-up.
#   - Everything, when the refund also moved money OUTSIDE our ledger (Stripe Connect
#     accounts, Stripe-held custom accounts, PayPal, or an active dispute): offsetting
#     our balance rows would not undo transfer reversals or connected-account debits,
#     so those cases are queued whole instead of auto-reversed.
#
# Idempotent: a re-delivered refund.failed webhook is a no-op once the failure has
# been handled (recorded on the refund inside the same transaction as the reversal).
