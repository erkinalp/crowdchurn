# The CLI's OAuth app mints tokens with the broad legacy `account` scope only,
# but the Pages write endpoints deliberately require the narrower `edit_profile`
# scope on the token itself (Api::V2::PagesController), so `gumroad pages push`
# fails for every CLI-authenticated user. Adding the scope to the app lets
# newly minted tokens carry it; existing tokens are unchanged and need a
# re-login (antiwork/gumroad-cli#185).

  # Rolling back removes edit_profile unconditionally, even if the scope was
  # already present before this migration ran (in which case `up` was a no-op).
  # That's deliberate: `down` restores the declared pre-migration state ("CLI
  # app does not carry edit_profile") rather than tracking whether `up` made a
  # change. The production app verifiably lacks the scope today, so in practice
  # the two are equivalent.
  #
  # Removing the scope from the application alone is not enough: endpoint
  # authorization checks the scopes stored on the access token, and Gumroad's
  # tokens never expire. Any token minted while this migration was deployed
  # would keep edit_profile forever, and pending/approved device authorizations
  # could still mint such a token later. So `down` also strips the scope from
  # every access token, access grant, and device authorization issued for this
  # application (same approach as
  # RevokeBackfilledEditEmailsScopeFromDefaultOauthApplications).
  #
  # Concurrency: MySQL does not wrap migrations in a transaction, so we open
  # one explicitly and take the same oauth_applications row lock used when
  # authorization sources are created, refresh tokens are exchanged, direct
  # application credentials are generated, and device codes are polled. Holding
  # that lock for the whole cleanup prevents a request that saw the old scopes
  # from inserting a new issuance source after its sweep. Ordering also matters:
  # issuance sources (device authorizations, then access grants) are cleaned
  # BEFORE access tokens, and tokens are swept LAST — so any token minted just
  # before we acquired the lock is still caught by the final token sweep instead
  # of slipping in after it.
